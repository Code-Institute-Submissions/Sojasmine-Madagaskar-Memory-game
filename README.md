### Project Descritpion

This site is about a single-player memory game to test a userâ€™s memory based on Madagascar the famous cartoon movie. The goal is to find and match a pair of cards images. It is a cool game to train user memory brain capacity. 
Memory games are good for training memory and are usually played by children but are also suitable for adults.
Based on my own proven experience, I have seen that introducing games gives children the conditions to practice their abilities for empathy and mathematical thinking. In the game memory, there is a basic structure based on turn-taking and consideration, which develops the empathic ability. Being able to see similarities and differences and talk about patterns and pairing, gives children the opportunity to develop their mathematical thinking.
This Javascript version of the memory game, using a 20 card deck for a single player.
The language used to build this project is HTML, CSS, Jquery and Javascript.

### UX
 According to [Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/), user experience is to meet the exact needs of the customer, without fuss or bother. Next comes simplicity and elegance that produce products that are a joy to own, a joy to use. True user experience goes far beyond giving customers what they say they want or providing checklist features. Total user experience is an even broader concept.

#### Project goals: 
   * User can see that the website is more appealing and well designed.
   * Player can understand the simple game instructions.
   * Player can have fun playing the game.
   * User can play anytime. 

#### User stories:
   * I want that it is easy to navigate and the website looks nice. 
   * As a game player, I want to test my brain memory with this game.
   * As a game player, I want to read a simple explanation about how to play this game.
   * As a game player, I hope that this game is funny to play and entertaining.
   * As a game player, I want to be able to play this game on a large screen.
   * As a game player. I want to be able to play this game om my mobile phone. 
   * As a game player, I want to play this game anytime.
   * As a game player, I want to see my score. 

#### Wireframes
   * I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) as an aid to visualize and design the website structure before starting the project development.

#### Strategy
   * I set out to make this friendly. It remembers me of my childhood as Madagascar is my homeland. And I wanted to share the happiness of being raised in a beautiful country rich in incredible nature and species. The game is just some fun for the user whether they are young or old.
   The idea of using Madagascar is quite fascinating. I made this game just for having fun by matching the pair of cards. 
#### Scope
   * The scope for me was that I want to create the feeling and sensation of watching the  Madagascar movie again and let the user remember the movie and recognize again the animals in the game. That is the reason why I choose the __lemur__ picture as the front face of the cards. Background music can be playing in the background to make this game more interesting not boring. 

#### Design and inspiration
   * I had a problem choosing a theme this time because my knowledge of Javascript is very limited and found it quite difficult. I read a lot of information and watched severals tutorial lessons on youtube. I learned a lot but still need more reading and improvement. Finally, I decided to modify a memory game. The idea behind the Madagascar cartoon come from me that this cartoon is very popular among children and even adults.
   * I was also inspired by reading some of Code Institutes students Github repositories on the __pree-code-preview__ in slack.

#### Colors
   
   * The colour scheme was chosen to tie in with the tropical flower, bright vibrant colours were selected to stand out in contract to the background but not to distract the play from the game itself.

   * The start game buttons is bootstrap primary-danger color and for the modal I used primary success.

  I used [coolors](https://coolors.co/) for the palettes.

#### Typography]

* Ma Shan Zheng was chosen as a font-family. 
* Horn is used for the font face.
* The start game is bootstra
